Put the assets of the project you want to build and the BuiltInAssets here.
When you build iOS application, the files in this folder should be like this:

ZXAssets
┃
┣━ Assets
┣━ BuiltInAssets
┗━ ProjectSetting.zxprjcfg

Two folder Assets and BuiltInAssets with one file ProjectSetting.zxprjcfg.
This ReadMe.txt file could be deleted if you want.
